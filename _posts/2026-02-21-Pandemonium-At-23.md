## Pandemonium
You know that feeling when you're immobilized by decision paralysis because there's a choice that you need to make that almost feels like one of life's major crossroads? That's me right now. Any choice I make has what feels like an almost uncomputable amount of downstream effects on my life. This passage is going to be a brain dump of all the things I've been considering in making a decision.


## Background
Roughly four years ago, I dropped out of UC Berkeley after my second year(May 2022) to work with some acquantances on a startup (Since then we've become best friends). I was the first engineer there and the third employee - I'm now the oldest tenured employee still around. We've gone through thick and thin together. From experiencing two major pivots, raising two rounds of funding, to building out an incredible team and working on fun problems; we've gone through the ups and downs of startup life and friendship together - practically coming of age in the process.

Now(more accurately Dec 2025), a friend of mine sought me out to work on a project together. She mentioned that it had interesting applications in an early space. I've always been interested in new technology so I happily agreed to spend a couple hours a week working together. Since then, the MVP has become usable and it's really promising.

So should I take the leap? And if so then when?

## The World In 10 Years...
In Dec 2022/Jan 2023, we pivoted into the AI consumer/prosumer/SMB space with an AI website builder. It was when GPT 3 was out and before ChatGPT came out. We were still called Relentlo at the time and rebranded into StyleAI to build out the AI driven tool suite for SMBs who didn't have dedicated marketing teams. Back then, AI was unreliable in latency, quality, and determinism. When we released the first variants of the text to website builder, we had to build in tons of redundancy and retries to make it work at all. There was definitely no production application of the technology at the time.

Flash forward to today, the use cases are emerging. Companies like Decagon, Sierra, Console, Serval are automating human work with AI agents. Multi agent systems are doing closed loop reasoning with evals that help them converge on real world ROI. The world's largest SAAS companies are seeing a stock market "SAAS pocalypse" (which I think is overcorrection because Salesforce is unlikely to not be a business necessity for quite awhile). What was unfeasible 3 years ago has slowly started becoming feasible in very specific use cases. The world's scarcest commodity of human intelligence is slowly starting to be commoditized. AI might not be good enough to replace all human use cases, but it's starting to be good enough in some. And it definitely can augment almost every use case.

Now how will the world look in a decade from now?
My take is that we will almost certainly reach the point where AI is good enough to be handling most domain specific use cases with evals. This is based on the current trajectory of improvement and the perhaps naive belief that even if AI stopped progressing today there's a plethora of new experiences that can ALREADY be created but haven't been discovered yet. This in and of itself is a gold rush opportunity. Now who knows whether we'll reach a true general intelligence model, but that case isn't really a case that we can prepare for anyways as that's the end of most white color work.

## Personal North Star
Right now, it's growth. My north star is to go where I can learn the most about building a generational company. 

Why do I want to build a generational company? 
There's a few reasons.
1. Asymmetric upside. Succeeding generates generational outcomes, and failing only exists when you quit. At my age, the risk is minimal due to the privilege of not having too many extraneous responsibilities.
2. Passion. It's fun.
3. Learning. You start broad and shallow, but as your company grows your field understanding specializes and you naturally specialize in terms of the technology and the industry. There's nowhere else you can learn nearly as much by just doing.
4. Community. I want to work around the clock and the startup community is the only one I've found filled with missionaries.

### Opportunity Cost
Now can Conversion provide these things? 
To an extent I believe it can. It's probably one of the best places in the world to be sans my own company. 
Let's measure against my north star metrics.
1. The asymmetric upside is there. The team is proven to be resilient, operationally impressive and battle hardened through all of our pivots. We know how to gradient descent our way to success. However, after four years I'm very invested in the business. Continuing to be at Conversion as an engineer siloes my horizontal view of the world in terms of engineering and people. The risk is that I'm already super overindexed on one company so there's gain in diversifying. Additionally, I've captured most of my upside already, and I'm already certain Conversion will win. Let it ride.
2. It's soooo fun. 
3. I've learned a ton getting to where I am - the most I've ever learned up to this point in my life. However, I'm at a trough in my learning. The next big jump is when the business hyper scales to a couple hundred employees. However, I don't know when that's going to happen nor do I know what my role will look like in that world. I do know that I won't be learning from a founders perspective but instead perhaps an engineering managers perspective. The question I've been agonizing over is this one. Not many companies ever hyper scale like that and Conversion is right on the cusp. That might be one of the most elite experiences one could experience before embarking on their founder journey.
4. The team is one of the best. Ever.

Other opportunity costs that I haven't covered are conventional ones I don't care too much about like job stability, steady income, and a somewhat stable-ish trajectory(there's still the startup risk). If I leave Conversion I'm willingly giving up the above, which do pretty closely hit my north star. 


## Relationships
Conversion has given me everything in terms of work, friends, and goals. The last thing I want to do is burn bridges here, I would lose what matters to me the most (the people). Right now, I'm working my hardest at Conversion to set them up for a potential future without me. I'm finishing what I perceive to be the most important engineering project for the business, and training people to be capable of closing the gaps. There will never not be a day where the first employee won't be useful in the engineering team and it's easy to leave, but it will also only ever get harder to leave. Not having the business to keep everything in our lives aligned will be tough, but I've met my best friends through this business and intend to keep those treasured relationships. My biggest fear is losing my best friends, either upon my personal failure to gracefully handle this or over a long period of time where we drift apart.


## It's Now or Never
Now the next question is when?
It's my take that the AI agent era is synonymous with the .com bubble or the mobile app era. It's a once in a decade opportunity where a new technology is capable of enabling new experiences that are 10x better than what existed before. Right now, there's a bubble of arbitrage where what silicon valley knows about technology is a little bit ahead of what the rest of the world/other industries is aware of. That's the perfect timing to be first movers on the next set of generational businesses. 

One thing I've also realized over the last 4 years at Conversion is that the team matters more than anything else. Having a wildly intelligent, resourceful cofounder is almost a non negotiable. I do feel like the stars have somewhat aligned where I've met the right person, who's come with the right idea, at the perfect time.


## Final Considerations
All in all though, I'm so unbelievably drawn to trying to start my own business that it's almost unfathomable not to try. The idea quite literally keeps me up at night. Rationally, the risk reduced EV is close and it's arguable that it's to stay at Conversion. The odds we hyper scale and I learn how to build a team of hundreds is quite good. But, I think the opportunity cost of not building a business in one of what I believe to be the most revolutionary technological shifts of my life is even more tremendous. I'm a risk forward guy generally and there might never be another opportunity in my life where I'm this young, free and irresponsible.
